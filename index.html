    <h1>Hey Babe üíñ</h1>
    <p>
Love is a small word to described wht i feel for you . If I had to explain how much I love you, I‚Äôd run out of words before I even began. You are not just someone I care about 
you are the love of my life 

I know I often act strong, like I‚Äôve got it all figured out. And in many ways, I do but only because you make me feel like I can conquer the world. Truth is, underneath all that confidence is a heart that‚Äôs terrified. Terrified because it‚Äôs found something it doesn‚Äôt ever want to lose. Something so rare, so precious‚Äîit makes the idea of losing it feel unbearable. That something is you, Chedza.

You are everything I would ever want. The way you smile, the way you speak, the way your eyes light up when you‚Äôre passionate about something‚Äîit‚Äôs all magic. And I can‚Äôt help but feel like I stumbled into a dream I never want to wake up from. You‚Äôve become a part of my every thought, my every hope, and every heartbeat.

There‚Äôs something about you that calms me, even when the world feels heavy. And yet, at the same time, you set my soul on fire. I imagine a future with you and suddenly everything makes sense‚Äîwhere I‚Äôm going, who I‚Äôm becoming. It all starts with you. You are my home.

Maybe I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôve never felt this deeply before. Because when you mean everything to someone, the idea of not having you becomes the scariest thing imaginable. But let me promise you this: I will always fight for you. For us. No matter how loud the world gets, I‚Äôll keep choosing you in the silence.

Chedza, my love, my everything thank you for being who you are. For making me believe in love the way I never thought I could. I love you beyond measure and time . And I‚Äôll keep loving you, in this life and every life after.
